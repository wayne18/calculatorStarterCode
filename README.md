# calculatorStarterCode
What does this project do?
1. This project is a virtual interactive calculator, the user inputs and the project outputs, implementing mathematical values such as the operations:
    -subtraction
    -multiplication
    -division
    -addition
    -square root
    -log of base 10
    -exponential powers

2. How does this project function?
    The project functions through its categories of mathematical operations listed above.
After the user inputs a algorithm to the project it will output the answer. For example, 8+8 is the algorithm and 
the output would be 16.

3. Things we would add if we had more time?
    -graphing 
    -more than one variable
    -SOH CAH TOA
    -modes for degree or radian
